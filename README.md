Machine Learning Algorithms Template


Repository contains some machine learning algorithm applications in a simplified form. Presented in the form of jupyter Notebooks.
Note: Data used in all the projects is for demonstration purposes only.

# Contents
### Regression
### Classification
 [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/rozhanam/ml-templates/blob/master/logistic_regression.ipynb) : Classify the customers based on their age and salary and model over their reaction to a social network ad.
### Clustering
 [Hierarchial Clustering](https://github.com/rozhanam/ml-templates/blob/master/Hierarchial_Clustering_template.ipynb) : Finding the natural grouping of customers based on their annual income and spending score with the help of hierarchial decompistion of the dataset in order to facilitate the developement of business strategies for enhancing the customer relationship management. 
 [K-Means Clustering]() : Finding the natural grouping pof customers based on their annual income and spending score with choosing mean as a cluster center and find mutually exclusive clusters of spherical shape based on distance. 
### Association Rule Learning 
 [Apriori Algorithm](https://github.com/rozhanam/ml-templates/blob/master/Apriori.ipynb)  : Optimizing sales by finiding the fequent item set in a grocerry store by association rule learning over transactional data.
